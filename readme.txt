1. A verbal or written explanation of your agent's design, including the ADK components
you would leverage.
Answer:
Agent Design Architecture: The agent is structured using React and TypeScript with the following core components:
HSNValidator: Main validation interface
ExcelReader: Handles data ingestion
ValidationEngine: Core validation logic

Data Flow:
User Input → Format Validation → Master Data Lookup → Hierarchical Validation → Result Display
Persistent storage using localStorage for session continuity
Real-time validation feedback with error handling

2. A clear description of the data handling strategy and validation logic
Answer:
Excel Processing:
Implemented in excelReader.ts
Supports both file upload and sample data(File Upload is an implementation I made as a quality of life change)
Data structure optimization:

/*
interface HSNData {
  HSNCode: string;
  Description: string;
}
*/

b) Storage Strategy:
In-memory caching for active session
localStorage persistence for frequent access
Lazy loading for large datasets

Validation Strategy: It is divided into 2 parts, Hierarchal and Format:
Format Validation:
const validateHSNFormat = (code: string): boolean => {
  return /^\d{1,8}$/.test(code);
};                  //Checks the format of the input csv values to hek if the are in the correct format. Ex: 01 might return Live Animals, but say someone enters ab, itll give an error message then.

b) Hierarchical Validation:
const findParentCode = (code: string, hsnData: HSNData[]): HSNData | null => {
  if (code.length <= 2) return null;
  for (let i = code.length - 2; i >= 2; i -= 2) {
    const parentCode = code.substring(0, i);
    const parent = hsnData.find(item => item.HSNCode === parentCode);
    if (parent) return parent;
  }
  return null;
};           //Checks the hierarchy of the inputted CSV value, if format is validated checking which cclass it belongs to.


3. An outline of the steps involved in building this agent using the ADK.
Answer:
Following everything ive learnt about SPM, I've divided the adk implementation and code into the following steps:

Initial Setup Phase:
Create a new ADK project workspace
Configure basic project settings like name, version, and description
Set up the development environment with necessary tools

Intent Definition Phase:
Create validation intents for single HSN code checks
Set up batch validation intent for multiple codes
Define training phrases for natural language understanding
Configure parameters to capture HSN codes from user input

Data Management Phase:
Implement Excel file reader for the master HSN data
Create data transformation logic to standardize input
Set up caching mechanism for faster subsequent validations
Implement data validation and cleaning procedures

Validation Logic Implementation:
Build format validation for HSN codes
Implement exact match validation against master data
Create hierarchical validation for parent-child relationships
Develop error handling and validation response formatting

Response Handler Development:
Create structured response templates
Implement error message formatting
Add suggestions for invalid codes
Include relevant HSN code descriptions

Testing and Quality Assurance:
Create unit tests for validation logic
Implement integration tests for data handling
Set up end-to-end testing scenarios
Validate edge cases and error conditions

Monitoring and Logging:
Set up performance metrics tracking
Implement error rate monitoring
Create logging for debugging and auditing
Configure alerts for critical issues

Deployment and Maintenance:
Prepare deployment configuration
Set up version control
Configure continuous integration
Establish update mechanisms
Documentation and Training:

Create technical documentation:
Write user guides
Prepare maintenance documentation
Document API specifications

Enhancement Planning:
Plan for future improvements
Consider scalability options
Prepare for master data updates
Design conversational enhancements

This structured approach ensures:
Robust validation capabilities
Efficient data handling
Reliable error management
Easy maintenance and updates
Clear monitoring and logging
Smooth deployment process
The agent can be easily extended with new features while maintaining its core validation functionality and performance standards.

4.Suggesting ways to make the agent more interactive or conversational
Answer:
TO make it more interactive and conversational, we can add AI components and :
Real-time validation feedback to help maximise effiiency
Batch validation support to help aid error management
Hierarchical relationship visualization to make CSV files more readable and accessible to human eyes
Search suggestions based on partial matches to aid in quality of life changes to ensure the success rate of our machine

5.Discussing how the agent could be extended to support updates to the HSN master
data without requiring a full redeployment.
Answer:
Supporting Updates Without Redeployment:

Store the HSN master data in a cloud database that can be updated in real-time
Create an admin interface where authorized users can upload new Excel files to update the master data(already done)
Implement versioning of the HSN codes so we can track changes over time
Add a feature to schedule updates during off-peak hours
Include a rollback mechanism in case an update introduces errors
Set up automatic validation of new data before it goes live
Create a staging environment where updates can be tested before going to production

6.Ideas for providing feedback on the quality or consistency of the HSN master data
itself, if patterns of invalidity suggest issues with the source.
Answer:
To increase quality and consistency of the HSN master data we can do the following:

Track patterns of invalid code searches to identify potential gaps in the master data
Create weekly reports showing commonly searched codes that don't exist in the database
Implement a system to detect duplicate or conflicting HSN code descriptions
Add alerts for unusual patterns, like many searches for similar invalid codes
Create a feedback loop where users can report potential errors in descriptions
Build a dashboard showing data quality metrics like:
{
Number of incomplete descriptions
Inconsistencies in hierarchy
Missing parent codes
Unusual gaps in code sequences
}
Generate suggestions for improving data quality based on user interaction patterns
Allow users to rate the helpfulness of descriptions to identify areas needing improvement
These enhancements would make the system more maintainable and reliable while continuously improving the quality of the HSN code database based on real-world usage.
